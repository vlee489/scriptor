File names can't have spaces!!!!!!!!

Place ONE python and/or bash script in this folder and boot the Pi. The scripts will automatically run.

Update Hostname
To update your hostname: place you desired hostname into a txt file name 'hostname.txt' and your pi will apply the new hostname then delete the hostname.txt file and reboot.
